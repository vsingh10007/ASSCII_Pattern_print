ASCII Pattern Printer (Java GUI)
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Java-based ASCII pattern printing program that uses a 2D array to store ASCII art representations of alphabets, numbers, and symbols.
The user interacts with the program through a GUI input dialog (Swing JOptionPane), making it easy to choose different operations.

It allows users to:

 -> Print all ASCII characters in a pattern.
 -> Print a single character in ASCII pattern. 
 -> Print entire words (with spaces and special characters).
 -> Print characters within a range.

✨ Features

Graphical User Input: Uses JOptionPane for menu and character/word input.

Multiple Print Options:

 -> Print all ASCII alphabet patterns.
 -> Print a single chosen character.
 -> Print full words/sentences.
 -> Print a range of characters (e.g., A–F).

2D Array Storage: Stores ASCII art patterns in arrays for easy lookup.
Loop-back Menu: After each operation, the program asks if the user wants to continue.
Supports Letters, Numbers & Special Characters (like @, ., etc.).

⚙️ How It Works

When the program starts, it shows a menu via JOptionPane:
   1 → Print all ASCII characters
   2 → Print one character
   3 → Print a word/sentence
   4 → Print characters in a range

Depending on the user’s choice:

  -> The program looks up the corresponding ASCII art from the 2D arrays (s, num, space).
  -> It then prints the result line by line in the console.
  -> After execution, the program asks if you want to continue (Press 1).

🖥️ Example Usage
Input (choice: 2)
Enter the One Character -- A

📌 Future Improvements

Add colorful ASCII output using ANSI escape codes.

Create a JavaFX/Full GUI interface instead of console output.

Add file saving option to export ASCII patterns as .txt.
